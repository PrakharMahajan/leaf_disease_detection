# leaf_disease_detection
This is a simple convolutional neural network project. The project identifies whether a leaf is diseased or healthy, based on the image provided by the user.

To RUN the code, follow these steps:
#STEP 1: 
  --> Download the dataset and save it in a local directory

#STEP 2:
  --> RUN the Import_dataset.py file in your IDE
  --> RUN the Architecture.py file
  --> And finally, RUN the Predict.py file



Also, since the dataset is very large, one can download any leaf dataset from kaggle or UCI and then classify the whole dataset into two seperate folders namely "Healthy" and "Diseased".
Then, save these two folders into another folder named, 'Dataset' and save it in the same location as the Import_dataset.py file.
